# Value Prop

Page Goal: launch list signup

Target Audience:
- remote workers and managers who...
  - don't use slack huddles or discord voice channels. i.e., use...
    - microsoft teams, google workspace, zoom, webex, etc.
    - and don't have access to dedicated voice channels and multiple screen sharing
- pain points:
  - team members feeling isolated, lonely
  - socializing and teambuilding feels forced
  - miss the serendipity and spontaneity of in-office work
  - collaboration is more fatiguing and inefficient than in-person
  - loss of culture and tribal knowledge circulation
  - hesitant to start casual conversations with team members
  - text chat and email are too slow, or too formal
  - waiting for a scheduled meeting to resolve an issue is inefficient, frustrating
- traffic source
  - facebook
  - linkedin

Value Proposition:
- Unlock the serendipity/ease/bandwidth of in-person collaboration for your remote team.
  - Eliminate the friction of coordinating calls with dedicated voice channels. Join a conversation with a single click. Hang out and chat or just listen-in. No need for a formal meeting.
  - Show your entire workspace with multi-screen sharing.
  - Share more freely. Trivially bring your entire workspace to the conversation. Share as many screens or windows as you like, and view your teams' screens in full resolution with multi-monitor support.

# Information Hierarchy

pain points: (in addition to the above)
- fear of interrupting. i.e., don't want to schedule a call just to chat
- fear of being left out of important conversations. can't see what conversations are heppening
- opportunity cost: what conversations aren't being had? informal conversation can lead to important technical or product insights
- frustrating screen sharing and viewing limitations:
  - If this were in-person one could simply look over your shoulder and see your entire workspace.
  - Why can we only share one screen at a time? what if you have multiple monitors or windows that you need to share? You either squish everything to fit into one screen or you have to keep switching windows.
  - What if you have a giant monitor? You'd like to organize shared screens into a grid to best utilize your available screen real-estate.
- pain scenario: you're blocked on some task or decision. you send an email or text chat to some colleagues who might be able to help. Now you're twiddling your thumbs waiting for a reply... This delay is annoying. Should you call someone direcly? Who would be most appropriate? Maybe wait a bit more... someone will probably reply soon. Worst case there's the team meeting this afternoon.
- pain scenario: the first 5-10 minutes of every meeting is spent trying to get everyone into the call. Either the link doesn't work, someone can't find the meeting invite, or some is using the wrong meeting invite. Why does it need to be more complicated than everyone walking into the same conference room like the old days?
- pain scenario: trying to orchestrate an impromptu meeting is requires messaging or emailing everyone to check their availability, sending out invite links. The effort required and the amount of disruption involved discourages even considering a meeting. Instead, the conversation is kept asynchronous (over email or text chat) or scheduled for a future date, which may be several days out or at an inconvenient time since everyone's schedules need to align. Ad-hoc meetings are a rarity

benefits (what does product let users do? what value do they get?):
- Speak with your coworkers as if you were all in the same room together
- See at a glance who is talking to whom, without needing to join the meeting or interrupt
- Starting a conversation is as simple as saying "Hey". The "walkie-talkie" nature of dedicated voice channels means you're already connected.
- No more juggling which screen or window to share in a presentation or collaboration.
- Meetings can start on-time
- increase productivity: Teams can make decisions and iterate faster when communication barriers are lowered.
- Improve morale: individuals feel less isolated when there are more organic opportunites for collaboration. Casual conversation can actually be a thing.
- Foster spontaneity and serendipity: casual or impromptu conversations can lead to new technical insights or product innovations. This also helps circulate tribal knowledge and company culture.
- No more need for manditory "virtual happy hour". Nobody likes this. It feels forced and inauthentic.

differentiators (what makes my product unique? how is it different from MS Teams?):
- persistent voice channel instead of "calls".
  - No need to send out links to the call because the voice channels are persistent. You set them up once and they can be re-used, like a meeting room in your office
  - Like the physical office, different voice channels can have a different work context associated with them. Some channels can be reserved for pre-planned meetings, others can be for specific teams or projects, other channels can be for casual hangouts. Notice your colleagues chatting in the lunch room? Simply join them and say "Hi" like you would in real life. No need to put a "Lunch Call" on the calendar.
- support for multiple screen sharing
  - With Teams, only 1 person can share their screen at a time. Even better than letting multiple people share screens simultaneously, people can share multiple screens at a time.
  - Better control over which video streams you want to focus on. Pop-out individual streams into their own window that you can move to a different monitor or resize to make ideal use of your screen real estate.
- presence signaling
  - See at a glance which channels your teammates are in, who's talking, who's muted, who is sharing their screen or who is away.
  - See if a meeting is still ongoing or if you team is available to chat
