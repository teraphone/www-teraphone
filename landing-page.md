# Value Prop

Page Goal: launch list signup

Target Audience:
- remote workers and managers who...
  - don't use slack huddles or discord voice channels. i.e., use...
    - microsoft teams, google workspace, zoom, webex, etc.
    - and don't have access to dedicated voice channels and multiple screen sharing
- pain points:
  - team members feeling isolated, lonely
  - socializing and teambuilding feels forced
  - miss the serendipity and spontaneity of in-office work
  - collaboration is more fatiguing and inefficient than in-person
  - loss of culture and tribal knowledge circulation
  - hesitant to start casual conversations with team members
- traffic source
  - google search
  - reddit
  - facebook
  - linkedin

Value Proposition:
- Unlock the serendipity/ease/bandwidth of in-person collaboration for your remote team.
  - Eliminate the friction of coordinating calls with dedicated voice channels. Join a conversation with a single click. Hang out and chat or just listen-in. No need for a formal meeting.
  - Show your entire workspace with multi-screen sharing.
  - Share more freely. Trivially bring your entire workspace to the conversation. Share as many screens or windows as you like, and view your teams' screens in full resolution with multi-monitor support.

# Information Hierarchy

pain points: (in addition to the above)
- fear of interrupting. i.e., don't want to schedule a call just to chat
- fear of being left out of important conversations. can't see what conversations are heppening
- opportunity cost: what conversations aren't being had? informal conversation can lead to important technical or product insights
- frustrating screen sharing and viewing limitations:
  - If this were in-person one could simply look over your shoulder and see your entire workspace.
  - Why can we only share one screen at a time? what if you have multiple monitors or windows that you need to share? You either squish everything to fit into one screen or you have to keep switching windows.
  - What if you have a giant monitor? You'd like to organize shared screens into a grid to best utilize your available screen real-estate.
